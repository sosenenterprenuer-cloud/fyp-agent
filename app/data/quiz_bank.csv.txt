Different Y values for the same X is a violation.
Which best defines a Functional Dependency (FD)?,Normalization & Dependencies,One attribute uniquely determines another,A many-to-many relationship,All attributes are keys,Attributes are entirely unrelated,One attribute uniquely determines another,FD (X->Y) means the value of X determines the value of Y.
What is the closure of an attribute set?,Normalization & Dependencies,All attributes functionally determined by the set,Only the primary keys of the relation,All foreign keys only,The number of tuples in the relation,All attributes functionally determined by the set,The closure (X+) is the set of all attributes that X can functionally determine in the relation.
If a table contains multi-valued attributes or repeating groups, which Normal Form is violated?,Normalization & Dependencies,Second Normal Form (2NF),Third Normal Form (3NF),First Normal Form (1NF),Boyce-Codd Normal Form (BCNF),First Normal Form (1NF),1NF requires that all attributes hold only single (atomic) values, removing repeating groups and multi-valued attributes.
What is the main objective of converting a table from 1NF to 2NF?,Normalization & Dependencies,To remove transitive dependencies,To remove partial dependency on a composite key,To simplify the table structure to one column,To add more data redundancy,To remove partial dependency on a composite key,2NF addresses partial dependency, where a non-key attribute depends on only part of a composite primary key.
In a table with a composite primary key (A, B), if non-key attribute C depends only on A, what type of dependency exists?,Normalization & Dependencies,Transitive dependency,Partial dependency,Full functional dependency,Multivalued dependency,Partial dependency,Since C depends on only part (A) of the composite key (A, B), it is a partial dependency, violating 2NF.
What type of dependency is eliminated by moving a table from 2NF to 3NF?,Normalization & Dependencies,Partial dependency,Transitive dependency,Full functional dependency,Trivial dependency,Transitive dependency,3NF eliminates transitive dependency, where a non-key attribute depends on another non-key attribute.
Table: `STUDENT_GRADE(StudentID, CourseID, ProfessorName)`. PK=(StudentID, CourseID). FD: `CourseID -> ProfessorName`. Which NF is violated?,Normalization & Dependencies,Third Normal Form (3NF),Second Normal Form (2NF),First Normal Form (1NF),Boyce-Codd Normal Form (BCNF),Second Normal Form (2NF),ProfessorName depends on only part (CourseID) of the composite key, violating 2NF.
Which is allowed in 3NF?,Normalization & Dependencies,Non-key attribute determines another non-key attribute,Key determines non-key attribute,Part of a key determines a non-key attribute,A table contains repeating groups,Key determines non-key attribute,The rule requires that every non-key attribute depends only on the primary key (no transitive dependency).

What does 2NF ensure regarding non-key attributes?,Normalization & Dependencies,That they are fully dependent on the primary key when the key is composite,That they only depend on other non-key attributes,That they are always unique,That they are always null,That they are fully dependent on the primary key when the key is composite,In 2NF, non-key attributes must rely on the entire composite primary key.
Which is NOT a goal of database normalization?,Normalization & Dependencies,To reduce data redundancy,To avoid insertion, update, and deletion anomalies,To increase query processing time,To increase data integrity and consistency,To increase query processing time,Normalization is done to minimize redundancy and maximize integrity, which typically improves efficiency.

Which NF is violated?,Normalization & Dependencies,Second Normal Form (2NF),First Normal Form (1NF),Third Normal Form (3NF),Boyce-Codd Normal Form (BCNF),Third Normal Form (3NF),DeptName depends on DeptID (Non-key -> Non-key), which is a transitive dependency violating 3NF.
